<h2>Hi!, I'm Annie! <img src="https://c.tenor.com/nxEME4zuezEAAAAi/cutie-cat-chan.gif" width="50"></h2>

<h5>I'm a Web Development student at Trybe. My passion is creating things!</h5>
<p>When I was little, I would work with software like Game Maker and Visual Studio C++ to express ideas that I had in my mind and turn them into something tangible, and to this day that is my goal!<p>

<h5>My values are...</h5>
<p>
ðŸŒŸ Self-expression and being myself<br>
ðŸ’– Treating everyone with love and empathy<br>
ðŸ“– Being open to new ideas, and free of preconceptions<br>
</p>
